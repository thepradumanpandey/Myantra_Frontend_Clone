ðŸš€ Day 1 of Building a Myntra Front-End Clone ðŸš€

I'm excited to share that I've started working on my first front-end project, a clone of the Myntra website!

Today, I focused on creating the header, which includes:

Navigation Bar: Categories such as Men, Women, Kids, Home & Living, Beauty, and Studio.
Action Buttons: Profile, Wishlist, and Bag icons for easy access.
Search Input: A search bar for seamless product search.
I'm looking forward to adding more features and improving the design in the coming days. You can check out my progress and code on GitHub.

Stay tuned for more updates!
